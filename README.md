# amir-typescript-backend
My own version of express typescript template. It was from express-generator-typescript but I stripe packages that I don't use and makes file structure changes

## usage
### npm run start:dev
To start the developement server. Everytime time there is changes, ESLint will run automatically because the nodemon contains a modified code to run Eslint every file changes
### npm run build
To build the project which is NECESSARY before the uploading the project to production
### npm run start
To run the production build. Remove the /scr folder (in the root ofcouse) as this folder is not use during production of the project
